 ## data analysis
 The correlation coefficient r and p value were calculated by income group.
 
1. association between alcconsumption and lifeexpectancy for LOW income countries
(-0.047579447175847799, 0.76190722376811137)
       
2. association between alcconsumption and lifeexpectancy for MIDDLE income countries
(0.12151900360618491, 0.26791660109908982)
       
3. association between alcconsumption and lifeexpectancy for HIGH income countries
(0.31514970015521221, 0.039545919662409133)

The low income group and middle income group do not have siginicant p value (>0.05) and the correlation is weak.

The high income group has siginicant p value (<0.05) and the correlation is intermediate. 
The graphs confirmed this trend.
